To prevent card owners from disputing fuel withdrawals and the collection of monthly petrol allowance, all transactions will be digitally signed by both the terminal and the card and stored in the database. These can then be referenced in cases of disputes. As such, in addition to the certificates used in Section \ref{section:mutualauth} for mutual authentication, both cards and terminals have a second certificate used for digital signatures which adheres to the same certificate hierarchy.
